# BeaverBrains

**Have you ever struggled to find classmates to study with?**

Welcome to BeavreBrains! The best way to find your Oregon State Study group.

For the Fall2023 Beaver Hacks Hackathon, our group decided to challenge ourselves to create a tool for the OSU community to help build relationships and raise GPAs. The goal of BeaverBrains is to help OSU students connect with one another. We wanted to make it easy to see who was in your classes and how to reach out to them. This project is still a work in progress, but once it's done we hope it will be a widely used resource on campus to help people network.
