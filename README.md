**Have you ever struggled to find classmates to study with?**

## Welcome to BeavreBrains! The best way to find your Oregon State Study group.

# What For?
For the Fall2023 Beaver Hacks Hackathon, our group decided to challenge ourselves to create a tool for the OSU community to help build relationships and raise GPAs. The goal of BeaverBrains is to help OSU students connect with one another. We wanted to make it easy to see who was in your classes and how to reach out to them. This project is still a work in progress, but once it's done we hope it will be a widely used resource on campus to help people network. 

# How did the Hackathon Go?
Overall the hackathon was a little rough, the project was built over a 2 day period and we hit massive speed bumps the second day. Even though we struggled, we are determined to bring this project into reality. Stay tuned for updates and more about BeaverBrains

# How to use?
For now BeaverBrains is a work in progress but will soon be published as a fully functioning web app!
